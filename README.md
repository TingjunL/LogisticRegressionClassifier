The main purpose of the project is design a logisctic regression classifier to solve the ubiquitination detection problem. 
We got a huge unbalanced data set. We optimized the datset and trained the classifier using Weka, optimazed the classifier and did validation using matlab. Here we provide the matlab code. You can find out the steps in project report. Also we attached the presentation files.

Have fun with this LogisticRegressionClassifier! ;)
